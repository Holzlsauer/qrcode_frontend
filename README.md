# qrcode_frontend

:iphone: Frontend using React Native for a project in a software engineering lab course.

The aim of project is to create a system to automatically validate students' attendance in classes using qrcode.
Prior to each class, professors validate a qrcode which activates the system that makes their class available. Next, students joining the class can validate their presence though the same qrcode system.
